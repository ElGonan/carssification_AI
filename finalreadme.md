## Abstract
This project presents a detailed evaluation of a deep learning model for the
classification of car parts into 40 distict classes using a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based on the ResNet50 architecture. The model employs transfer
learning by leveraging pretrained weights from ResNet50[8], which enhances its
performance in distinguishing between multiple classes of car parts.

The model is constructed with several layers, that results in a model capable of
multiclass classification. Training is conducted using categorical crossentropy
as the loss function and the Adam optimizer, with early stopping and model
checkpointing implemented to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal performance.

Evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, are computed
from the confusion matrix to assess model performance. The results indicate
that the model achieves a validation accuracy of up to 90.5%, with a precision
of 94.7%, a recall of 94%, and an F1-score of 93.8%. This comprehensive
approach demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in automating the
classification of car parts, thereby facilitating enhanced workflows in
automotive industries.

## Introduction
The increasing number of vehicles, associated with the introduction of Chinese
vehicles in our country comes with a series of benefits and downsides, one of the
downsides is the increasing number of car parts being damaged, due to accidents or
errors in the dealerships. This problem impacts many lines of service, incluiding
dealerships and work shops. In order to detect which parts are damaged, first is
necesasry to be able to detect these parts automatically[1] To contribute to this 
challenge, this project will focus on developing an image classification model 
capable of recognizing and categorizing vehicle parts from images.

This project employs a deep learning approach, specifically using a Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet50 architecture. CNNs are particularly 
well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically 
learn and extract features from images, making them highly effective for tasks involving 
visual data. The ResNet50 architecture, with its deep residual learning framework, 
allows for the training of very deep networks while addressing the vanishing gradient
problem, which is a common issue in deep learning[9].

The model used model is based on the ResNet50 architecture, one of the most widely used models
for image classification tasks, along with transfer learning techniques to improve
the model's performance. Transfer learning allows the model to leverage
pretrained weights from a model trained on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, to
enhance its ability to classify images of car parts. This approach is particularly
effective when the dataset is limited, as it allows the model to learn from
features learned from a larger dataset, thereby improving its accuracy and
generalization capabilities[4].

## Material and Methods
### Dataset 
The dataset used in this study was sourced from Kaggle, specifically from a repository 
containing [images of various car parts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/car-parts-40-classes).
This dataset is structured in folders representing different classes, facilitating its 
use in machine learning models.

The dataset followed the next structure:
```
- train
- test
- valid
- car parts.csv
```
and the labels are as follows:
| 1-10  | 11-20 | 21-30 | 31-40  |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| AIR COMPRESSOR     | CYLINDER HEAD     | LOWER CONTROL ARM| RIM                 |
| ALTERNATOR         | DISTRIBUTOIR      | MUFFLER          | SPARK PLUG          |
| BATTERY            | ENGINE BLOCK      | OIL FILTER       | STARTER             |
| BRAKE CALIPER      | FUEL IJNECTOR     | OILF PAN         | TAILLIGHTS          |
| BRAKE PAD          | FUSE BOX          | OVERFLOW TANK    | THERMOSTAT          |
| BRAKE ROTOR        | GAS CAP           | OXYGEN SENSOR    | TORQUE CONVERTER    |
| CAMSHAFT           | HEADLIGHTS        | PISTON           | TRANSMISSION        |
| CARBERATOR         | IDLER ARM         | RADIATOR         | VACUUM BRAKE BOOSTER|
| COIL SPRING        | IGNITION COIL     | RADIATOR FAN     | VALVE LIFTER        |
| CRANKSHAFT         | LEAF SPRING       | RADIATOR HOSE    | WATER PUMP          |


## Methodology
### Preprocessing
The dataset is distributed as follows:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/numinstancestrain.png" alt="Figure 1. Dataset Distribution (Train)" width="600"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 1. Dataset Distribution (Train)</em></p>

each instance is from a fixed size (254x254 pixles) and they are already
separated in folders by class, so the preprocessing steps are minimal,
only requiring to define a batch size which is set to 16[8] and to
define a class mode which is set to 'categorical' since the model
is a multiclass classification model.

The Validation and test sets are also already separated as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/numinstancesvalid.png" alt="Figure 2. Dataset Distribution (Validation)" width="400"/>
  <img src="./images/numinstancestest.png" alt="Figure 3. Dataset Distribution (Test)" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 2. Dataset Distribution (Validation) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 3. Dataset Distribution (Test)</em>
</p>


Thus, they also required almost no preprocessing. However since the validation
and Test data are not as sustantial as the training data, Data Augmentation
was applied to both Validation and Test sets to increase the number of
instances and improve the model's generalization capabilities. The augmentation
techniques are:
```
- rotation range
    - 10
- width shift range
    - 0.2
- height shift range
    - 0.2
- horizontal flip
    - True
```

Also as part of the preprocessing the `process_input` function from keras was
used, this is due to the normalization process requiered by ResNet50 which
requieres the images to be preprocessed in a specific way. This process consists
basically in inverting the RGB channels to BGR, and then subtracting the mean
pixel value from each channel[7].

## Model selection
To tackle the problem of classifying car parts, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
based on the ResNet50 architecture was selected as the state of the art has shown[1][2][4][5][6]
that CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks. Along with the ResNet50
architecture, transfer learning was employed to generate a model with increased accuracy
and generalization capabilities.

## Model Architecture
ResNet50 (Residual Network 50) is a deep convolutional
neural network that has been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions
of images across thousands of categories. The Residual Network architecture works by
introducing skip connections, allowing gradients to flow through the network more 
effectively during training. This helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, 
enabling the training of very deep networks.

In the specific case of ResNet50, the model consists of 50 layers, including
convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, and fully connected layers. The
model is designed to learn hierarchical features from images, starting from low-level
features such as edges and textures, to high-level features such as shapes and objects.
The model is trained using a large dataset of labeled images, allowing it to learn
the patterns and characteristics of different classes of images[9].

Along with the ResNet50 model, the custom model architecture is a sequential model
that has the next hyperparameters:

| Name | Parameters |
|------|------------|
| ResNet50|   PreTrained   |
|Global Average Pooling| 2D | 
| Dense | 512, ReLU activation |
| Dense |256, ReLU activation |
| Dense |128, ReLU activation |
| Dense |40, Softmax activation |

This architecture consists of a ResNet50 model as the base allowing the transfer
learning to take advantage of the pretrained weights, followed by a global average pooling
layer to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, and then three fully connected
layers with ReLU activation functions to learn complex features from the images.
Finally, a dense layer with 40 units and a softmax activation function is used to
output the probabilities for each of the 40 classes of car parts.

The model is trained using categorical crossentropy as the loss function and the Adam
optimizer, with early stopping marked at the fifth non-improvement epoch and model 
checkpointing implemented to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal performance. 

## Training and first evaluation
The batch size and number of epochs was selected as 16[6] and 25[1] respectively, as it
is closer to the state of the art and it is a good balance between training time and
model performance. The model was trained using the training set and got the next metrics:
```
- Precision
    - 89.4%
- Recall
    - 87.5%
- F1-score
    - 87.2%
```
This metrics where calculated using the confusion matrix, which is presented on figure 4.
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/secondimprovedModel/descarga (2).png" alt="Figure 1. Dataset Distribution (Train)" width="600"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 4. Confusion Matrix. First evaluation</em></p>


This metrics and the Figure 5 indicates that there's room for improvement as overfitting
(high training accuracy and low validation accuracy) is present. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images//secondimprovedModel/descarga.png" alt="Figure 2. Dataset Distribution (Validation)" width="400"/>
  <img src="./images//secondimprovedModel/descarga (1).png" alt="Figure 3. Dataset Distribution (Test)" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 5. Model accuracy and Loss. First evaluation</em>
</p>

This data allows us to conclude that, even though the model is able to
classify car parts with a good degree of accuracy, it is not generalizing well to
unseen data, as the validation accuracy is significantly lower than the training
accuracy. This indicates that the model is overfitting to the training data, meaning
that it is learning the noise and details of the training data rather than the
underlying patterns that are common to all car parts.

## Model refinement

After the first evaluation, the model was refined by adding dropout layers to
the architecture to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capabilities.
The refined model architecture is as follows:

| Name | Parameters |
|------|------------|
| ResNet50|     |
| Dropout | 0.3 |
|Global Average Pooling|  | 
| Dense | 512, ReLU activation |
| Dropout | 0.3 |
| Dense |256, ReLU activation |
| Dense |128, ReLU activation |
Dropout | 0.2 |
| Dense |40, Softmax activation |

This specific architecture introduces dropout layers after the ResNet50 model and
after each dense layer, with dropout rates of 0.3, 0.3, and 0.2 respectively.
This helps to reduce overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0
during training, which forces the model to learn more robust features and prevents it
from relying too heavily on any specific feature.

## Retraining and final evaluation

After the refinment of the model, the model was retrained using the same
training set and the same parameters. The model achieved the next metrics:

```
- Precision
    - 94.7%
- Recall
    - 94.0%
- F1-score
    - 93.8%
```

If we see the Figure x, we can see that
the model is not overfitting and the validation accuracy is close to the training
accuracy, which indicates that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.

It's important to note that even though the model had 25 epochs, the early stopping
was triggered at the 10th epoch which indicates that the model reached a point
where it was not improving anymore, thus preventing overfitting and saving training time (and
resources).

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/lastModel/Final_plotedite.png" alt="Figure x. Model Accuracy and loss" width="600"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure x. Model Accuracy and loss</em></p>

The model was also evaluated using a confusion matrix, which shows the
number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. The confusion matrix
is shown in Figure x. The figure shows that the model is able to
classify most of the classes correctly, with some classes having a higher
number of misclassifications than others. The diagonal values represent the
number of correct predictions for each class, while the off-diagonal values
represent the number of misclassifications.
<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/lastModel/Final_Matrix.png" alt="Figure x. Confusion Matrix" width="600"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure x. Confusion Matrix</em></p>

This results indicate that the diagnosis of the model was correct and the
model is capable of classifying car parts with a high degree of accuracy.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the project successfully developed a deep learning model for
the classification of car parts into 40 distinct classes using a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet50 architecture. The model employed
transfer learning techniques to enhance its performance, leveraging pretrained
weights from ResNet50 to improve its ability to classify images of car parts.

Even though the model got good results, there is still room for improvement.
Future work could involve further refining the model architecture, experimenting
with different hyperparameters, and exploring additional data augmentation techniques
to improve the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, the model could
be tested on a larger and more diverse dataset to evaluate its performance in real-world
scenarios. The model could also be integrated into a larger system for automating
the classification of car parts, which could facilitate enhanced workflows in
automotive industries.

Also, the model can be implemented on a mobile device or a web application
to allow users to classify car parts in real-time, which could be useful for
dealerships, workshops, and other automotive industries. This could help to
automate the process of identifying damaged car parts, thereby improving
efficiency and reducing the time required for repairs.
