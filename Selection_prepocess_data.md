### Selection of the dataset
There are many datasets out there but due to my limited knowledge on
AI, I decided to stick my machine learning model to be similar to the ones
we do on class. Checking different repositories of datasets, I encountered
Kaggle which is one of the most popular dataset repositories out there. 

Once inside, I decided to start looking to Classification Datasets, that way
I can apply what we see on classes here. However no dataset was interesting
enough for me. So I decided to ask my family for ideas. Then my brother
suggested the car parts classification and I liked it. So I just went to look
for it on Kaggle and bingo, found it.

### Separation
The dataset uploaded by gpiosenka is already separated in different folders:
First, we have 1 dataset smaller than the other one, which works more like a 
compliment to the first one.
- car parts
- car parts 50

The first car parts folder contains 40 different labels, and it's the one
I'll be using.

The main structure is:
- train
- test
- valid
- car parts.csv
- EfficientNetB2-40-(224 X 224)- 96.90.h5

The 40 labels i'll be working with are:
- AIR COMPRESSOR
- ALTERNATOR
- BATTERY
- BRAKE CALIPER
- BRAKE PAD
- BRAKE ROTOR
- CAMSHAFT
- CARBERATOR
- COIL SPRING
- CRANKSHAFT
- CYLINDER HEAD
- DISTRIBUTOIR
- ENGINE BLOCK
- FUEL INJECTOR
- FUSE BOX
- GAS CALIPERHEADLIGHTS
- IDLER ARM
- IGNITION COIL
- LEAF SPRING
- LOWER CONTROL ARM
- MUFFLER
- OIL FILTER
- OIL PAN
- OVERFLOW TANK
- OXYGEN SENSOR
- PISTON
- RADIATOR
- RADIATOR FAN
- RADIATOR HOSE
- RIM
- SPARK PLUG
- STARTER
- TAILLIGHTS
- THERMOSTAT
- TORQUE CONVERTER
- TRANSMISSION
- VACUUM BRAKE BOOSTER
- VALVE LIFTER
- WATER PUMP
